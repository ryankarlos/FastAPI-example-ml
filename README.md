# Examples of deploying and hosting a Machine Learning Model with FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance, batteries-included Python web framework that's perfect for building RESTful APIs. It can handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests and has built-in support for data validation, JSON serialization, authentication and authorization, and OpenAPI.
It has a lightweight microframework feel with support for Flask-like route decorators.

* It takes advantage of Python type hints for parameter declaration which enables data validation (via pydantic) and OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
* It supports the development of asynchronous APIs. It's fast. Since async is much more efficient than the traditional 
  synchronous threading model
